This repository introduces the Copernicus Climate Change’s Services’ (C3S) resources developed to support the European Environment Agency (EEA) Climate Adapt. 

## European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE) indicator visualisation application

The European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE) indicator visualisation application (referred to as ECDE application hereafter) is a web application of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) allowing for flexible temporal and spatial exploration and analysis of recent past trends and projected future changes of a range of key climate indicators from multiple datasets.  

https://apps.copernicus-climate.eu/c3s-apps/ecde/

The development of the ECDE application was driven by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to address informational needs regarding climate impact indicators relevant to climate change adaptation national initiatives across the EU. The list of indicators is based on a  [technical report](https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-cca/products/etc-cca-reports/climate-related-hazard-indices-for-europe) from the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation (ETC-CCA). 

These indicators describe how climate variability and change of essential climate variables can impact sectors such as health, agriculture, forestry, energy, tourism, or water and coastal management and have been used in VALORADA in the implementation of the climate dashboards.

The data underlaying the indicators shown in the application are available in the [following CDS catalogue](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-ecde-climate-indicators?tab=overview) entry and the underpinning data used to compute the indicators is documented in the following [document](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Input+data+underpinning+the+European+Climate+Data+Explorer%3A+Description+of+the+datasets+and+variables). This data is derived from ERA 5 reanalysis and an ensemble of downscaled Euro-Cordex projections, available as a full time series for individual models. 

Through VALORADA, requirements have emerged to assist ‘non expert’ users with aggregated products to support regional and local climate risk assessment using the C3S data. To support intermediate users, C3S will soon publish a new dataset which provides multi-model statistics, pre-calculated reference periods, anomalies, climatology, ensemble statistics etc...) derived from the [Climate indicators for Europe from 1940 to 2100](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-ecde-climate-indicators?tab=overview) dataset. This catalogue entry correspond to the indicators made available through the interactive visualisation apps on the [European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE)](https://apps.copernicus-climate.eu/c3s-apps/ecde/).

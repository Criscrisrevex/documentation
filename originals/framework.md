# Data-Valuation-Framework

Putting a value on data is tricky for two main reasons:

* The value of data depends on the situation in which it’s used.
* There’s no single measure that can make data value completely objective.

Even so, valuation methods can help estimate how useful data is and make that value easier to compare in different situations. These methods can be based on numbers or descriptions, and they can be either subjective (based on opinion) or objective (based on facts).

The **VALORADA Climate-data Valuation Framework** was created to help decision-makers understand and agree on the importance of existing data for reducing climate risks. 
It acts as a guide and a mental map, using a set of measures that highlight key ideas identified by climate adaptation experts. 

**The goal isn’t to create a fixed standard, but to encourage discussion about how valuable data and information are for tackling climate challenges.**

## Composition

The framework consists of: 

**Four value dimensions:** These represent the overarching categories used to assess the climate value of datasets. They reflect key conceptual areas relevant to climate-risk reduction, such as: 

* Relevance (defined as contribution to knowledge generation), 
* Strategic Value (defined as alignment with policy agendas), 
* Usability (defined in terms of resource efficiency), 
* Quality (referring to data provenance and accuracy). 

Each dimension frames a specific lens through which data value is interpreted and evaluated. 

**Twelve criterion (3 criterion for each value dimension):** Within each value dimension, criteria specify the evaluative focus and defines a specific attribute of a dataset. Definitions provide conceptual clarity for each criterion. They explain the rationale and scope of what is being measured. This ensures consistency in interpretation across different stakeholders and contexts.  

## Summary of Criteria and Definitions:

**Relevance**
* 1. Relevance to Climate Risk Understanding: Measures how well the dataset improves understanding of climate risks (vulnerability, exposure, impacts, adaptive capacity) and supports risk assessment.
* 2. Irreplaceability of the Dataset: Assesses uniqueness—whether the dataset provides critical, non-substitutable insights essential for knowledge generation. 
* 3. Performance Value: Evaluates versatility—how broadly the dataset applies across multiple climate risk indicators (hazards, vulnerabilities, exposure). 

**Strategic value**
* 1. Contribution to Risk Management and Decision-Making: Determines the dataset’s ability to enhance local governments’ capacity for mitigation, adaptation, and resilience planning. 
* 2. Support for Linking Climate Risk with Municipal Agendas: Examines how effectively the dataset integrates climate risk data into political and strategic municipal goals. 
* 3. Contribution to Connecting Regional and National Climate Policy: Assesses the dataset’s role in aligning local actions with regional/national climate policies and frameworks. 

**Usability**
* 1. Resource Efficiency: Evaluates ease of use without requiring significant additional resources (technology, funding, expertise). 
* 2. Fit within Existing Administrative and Political Structures: Measures compatibility with current mandates, workflows, and legal frameworks for smooth integration. 
* 3. Ongoing Maintenance Requirements: Considers effort, cost, and feasibility of keeping the dataset updated over time. 

**Quality**
* 1. Provenance of Data: Assesses transparency and documentation of data origins, collection, and curation processes. 
* 2. Precision and Accuracy: Evaluates how well the dataset reflects real-world conditions with detailed and correct information. 
* 3. Completeness of Data: Measures whether the dataset includes all necessary information without significant gaps.

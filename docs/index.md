# VALORADA Documentation

Welcome to the VALORADA project documentation. This site consolidates three core knowledge areas:

1. Climate Impact Chains (CICs) co-developed with stakeholders in demonstrator regions.
2. The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE) application and related datasets.
3. The VALORADA Climate-data Valuation Framework used to assess the value of datasets for climate risk reduction.

Use the left navigation to explore each section. A quick overview:

## 🧬 Climate Impact Chains
Cause–effect sequences linking climate hazards (heat, drought, wildfire, flood, etc.) to socio-economic and ecological impacts. Each chain page includes:
* Main risk statement
* Key policy issues
* Sequential impact diagrams (with descriptive alternatives)
* Narrative explaining mechanisms

## 📊 Data & Tools
How the ECDE application and derived Copernicus datasets support indicator-driven climate risk assessment and dashboards.

## 💠 Climate Data Valuation Framework
Structured criteria (Relevance, Strategic Value, Usability, Quality) with definitions, indicators, and scoring guidance to support transparent prioritisation of datasets.

# European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE) – Indicator Visualisation Application

The European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE) indicator visualisation application (referred to as the ECDE application) is a web application of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). It allows flexible temporal and spatial exploration and analysis of recent past trends and projected future changes for a range of key climate indicators from multiple datasets.

Application: <https://apps.copernicus-climate.eu/c3s-apps/ecde/>

## Purpose & Development
The development of the ECDE application was driven by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to address information needs regarding climate impact indicators relevant to national climate change adaptation initiatives across the EU. The list of indicators is based on a [technical report](https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-cca/products/etc-cca-reports/climate-related-hazard-indices-for-europe) from the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation (ETC‑CCA).

## Indicator Scope
The indicators describe how climate variability and change of essential climate variables can impact sectors such as health, agriculture, forestry, energy, tourism, and water/coastal management. They have been used in VALORADA during the implementation of climate dashboards.

## Data Access & Documentation
* Catalogue entry (indicator data): <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-ecde-climate-indicators?tab=overview>
* Underpinning data description: <https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Input+data+underpinning+the+European+Climate+Data+Explorer%3A+Description+of+the+datasets+and+variables>
* Sources: ERA5 reanalysis and an ensemble of downscaled Euro‑Cordex projections (full time series for individual models).

## Emerging User Requirements (VALORADA)
Through VALORADA, requirements emerged to assist non‑expert users with aggregated products for regional and local climate risk assessment using C3S data. To support intermediate users, C3S will publish a new dataset providing:
* Multi‑model statistics
* Pre‑calculated reference periods and anomalies
* Climatologies and ensemble statistics

These will be derived from the [Climate indicators for Europe from 1940 to 2100](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-ecde-climate-indicators?tab=overview) dataset—the same dataset that underpins the interactive ECDE application.

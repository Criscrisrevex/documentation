# VALORADA Climate-data Valuation Framework

Putting a value on data is challenging for two main reasons:
1. The value of data depends on the context in which it’s used.
2. No single measure can make data value completely objective.

Valuation methods can still help estimate usefulness and make value more comparable across contexts. Methods may be quantitative or qualitative, and subjective (judgement-based) or objective (evidence-based).

The **VALORADA Climate-data Valuation Framework** helps decision‑makers understand and reach consensus on the importance of existing data for reducing climate risks. It provides a structured mental map using measures highlighted by climate adaptation experts.

> The goal isn’t to impose a fixed standard, but to foster informed discussion about how valuable data and information are for tackling climate challenges.

## Composition
**Four Value Dimensions:**
* Relevance (contribution to knowledge generation)
* Strategic Value (alignment with policy agendas)
* Usability (resource efficiency & integration ease)
* Quality (provenance, accuracy, completeness)

**Twelve Criteria (3 per dimension):** Each criterion defines an attribute of a dataset; definitions clarify rationale and scope to ensure consistent interpretation.

## Criteria Overview
### Relevance
1. Climate Risk Understanding
2. Irreplaceability
3. Performance (versatility across indicators)

### Strategic Value
1. Decision‑making Capacity
2. Municipal Policy Alignment
3. Multi‑level Policy Connection

### Usability
1. Resource Efficiency
2. Fit with Existing Structures
3. Maintenance Requirements

### Quality
1. Provenance
2. Precision & Accuracy
3. Completeness

## Detailed Criteria (Excerpt)
### Relevance 1 – Climate Risk Understanding
Assesses contribution to understanding vulnerabilities, exposure, impacts, adaptive capacity. Indicators include: identification, quantification, socio‑economic & geospatial detail, temporal/spatial suitability, monitoring continuity.
Scoring: High (5–4), Moderate (3–2), Low (1–0).

### Relevance 2 – Irreplaceability
Evaluates uniqueness and non‑substitutability (granularity, historical continuity, region specificity). Scoring: High, Moderate, Low.

### Relevance 3 – Performance Value
Versatility across multiple risk indicators, compound risk support, multi‑scale applicability, integrability.

### Strategic Value 1 – Decision‑making Capacity
Directly informs prioritisation, planning, monitoring of adaptation/mitigation.

### Strategic Value 2 – Municipal Policy Alignment
Supports climate action plans, infrastructure management, cross‑sector coordination, regulatory compliance.

### Strategic Value 3 – Multi‑level Policy Connection
Aligns with regional/national frameworks; aids reporting and governance coordination.

### Usability 1 – Resource Efficiency
Ease of use without major new tools, funding or expertise; accessible formats; minimal training.

### Usability 2 – Fit with Existing Structures
Compatibility with mandates, workflows, legal/data governance; low integration friction.

### Usability 3 – Maintenance Requirements
Effort, cost, update frequency, automation potential, stability of sources.

### Quality 1 – Provenance
Transparency of origin, collection, curation, metadata quality, standards compliance.

### Quality 2 – Precision & Accuracy
Granularity, correctness, validation, bias absence, coverage of key variables.

### Quality 3 – Completeness
Inclusion of necessary variables, temporal continuity, spatial coverage, internal consistency.

## Scoring Guidance (0–5)
| Range | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 5–4 | High – strong support for climate risk reduction |
| 3–2 | Moderate – useful with limitations |
| 1–0 | Low – limited reliability/applicability |

## Suggested Evaluation Steps
1. Define decision context.
2. List candidate datasets.
3. Score each criterion (evidence + judgement).
4. Record rationale & uncertainty.
5. Aggregate (equal weights unless justified otherwise).
6. Prioritise for integration or investment.

# VALORADA Climate-data Valuation Framework

Putting a value on data is challenging because:
1. Value is context-dependent.
2. No single objective metric captures all dimensions.

This framework supports structured, multi-criteria dialogue among decision‑makers to prioritise datasets for climate risk reduction.

## Structure
* **Four Value Dimensions**: Relevance, Strategic Value, Usability, Quality
* **Twelve Criteria**: 3 per dimension
* **Indicators & Scoring**: Qualitative + semi‑quantitative guidance (0–5 scale)

## Dimensions & Criteria Overview

| Dimension | Criteria |
|-----------|---------|
| Relevance | Risk Understanding; Irreplaceability; Performance Value |
| Strategic Value | Decision-Making Capacity; Policy Alignment (Municipal); Multi-level Policy Connection |
| Usability | Resource Efficiency; Fit in Existing Structures; Maintenance Requirements |
| Quality | Provenance; Precision & Accuracy; Completeness |

---
## Relevance

### 1. Risk Understanding
Assesses contribution to understanding vulnerabilities, exposure, impacts, adaptive capacity.
**Indicators:** Identification, quantification, socio-economic & geospatial detail, temporal/spatial appropriateness, monitoring continuity.
**Scoring:** High (5–4) → Strong multi-faceted contribution; Moderate (3–2); Low (1–0).

### 2. Irreplaceability
Uniqueness & non-substitutability of insights (granularity, region-specific, historical continuity).
**Scoring:** High → Indispensable; Moderate → Partial uniqueness; Low → Easily replaceable.

### 3. Performance Value
Versatility across multiple risk indicators (hazards, exposure, vulnerability; compound risks; multi-scale applicability; integrability).
**Scoring:** High → Broad cross-domain utility; Moderate; Low.

---
## Strategic Value

### 1. Decision-Making Capacity
Direct support for prioritisation, planning, monitoring adaptation/mitigation.
**Indicators:** Actionable, localised, monitors progress.

### 2. Municipal Policy Alignment
Integration into political goals & operational priorities; cross-sector coordination.
**Indicators:** Supports climate action plans, infrastructure management, communication clarity, regulatory compliance, inter-departmental links.

### 3. Multi-level Policy Connection
Alignment with regional/national frameworks (adaptation strategies, reporting obligations, governance coordination).
**Indicators:** Target alignment, reporting support, cross-jurisdiction collaboration, evaluation of higher-level policies.

---
## Usability

### 1. Resource Efficiency
Ease of access/use without significant new tools, funding, expertise or political buy‑in.

### 2. Fit in Existing Structures
Compatibility with mandates, workflows, governance & data policies (privacy, interoperability).

### 3. Maintenance Requirements
Effort & cost to keep data updated (frequency, stability, automation potential).

---
## Quality

### 1. Provenance
Transparency of origin, collection, curation, metadata, standards compliance (e.g. OGC).

### 2. Precision & Accuracy
Granularity, correctness, validation, bias absence, coverage of key variables.

### 3. Completeness
Inclusion of all necessary variables, temporal continuity, spatial coverage, internal consistency.

## Scoring Guidance (0–5 Scale)

| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| 5–4 | High value – robust support for climate risk reduction |
| 3–2 | Moderate – useful but with limitations |
| 1–0 | Low – limited reliability or applicability |

Documenting rationale for each score increases transparency and consensus.

## Applying the Framework
1. Define decision context (e.g. heat adaptation plan).
2. List candidate datasets.
3. Evaluate each criterion (evidence + expert judgment).
4. Capture rationale & uncertainty notes.
5. Aggregate (simple average or weighted, if justified).
6. Prioritise datasets for integration / investment.

> Tip: Weighting should be explicit and agreed; default to equal weights unless a policy mandate requires emphasis.

## Example Lightweight Evaluation Template
| Dataset | Risk Understanding | Irreplaceability | Performance | Decision Capacity | Policy Alignment | Multi-level | Resource Eff. | Fit | Maintenance | Provenance | Precision | Completeness | Notes |
|---------|--------------------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|-----|------------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| X | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | High spatial detail; annual update |

## Next Steps
Potential evolutions include uncertainty scoring, cost-benefit overlays, and linkage to CIC impact severity indices.

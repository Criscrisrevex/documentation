# Climate Impact Chain 3: Drought Affecting Agriculture & Rural Livelihoods

**Main Risk:** Drought affecting agricultural production and rural livelihoods.

## Key Policy Issues
* Water scarcity & competing uses
* Soil erosion, salinisation & land degradation
* Declining productivity & livelihood vulnerability
* Need for sustainable water management & ecosystem restoration

## Sequences of Impacts

### 1. Heat & Specialised Species → Pests & Diseases

## Adaptation Considerations
* Integrated drought early warning & planning
* Soil conservation & regenerative practices
* Crop & livestock diversification
* Efficient irrigation & water allocation regimes
* Support programmes for rural livelihoods & migration management
* Riparian & aquatic ecosystem restoration

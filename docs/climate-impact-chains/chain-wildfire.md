# Climate Impact Chain 4: Wildfire Risk Escalation

**Main Risk:** Drought and heat increasing the risk of wildfire.

## Key Policy Issues
* Elevated wildfire risk (heat, drought, poor forest management)
* Fuel load from storms & lack of maintenance
* Tourism pressure increasing ignition & exposure
* Need for integrated forest & wildfire management

## Sequences of Impacts

### 1. Seasonal Extremes → Fuel Generation

## Adaptation Considerations
* Landscape fuel management & mosaic planning
* Sustainable forestry & maintenance regimes
* Fire-smart rural development & land stewardship incentives
* Tourism regulation (building codes, defensible space)
* Integrated wildfire prevention & emergency response systems

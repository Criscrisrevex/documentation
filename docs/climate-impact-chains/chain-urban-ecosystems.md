# Climate Impact Chain 1: Urban Ecosystems Degradation

**Main Risk:** Degradation of urban ecosystems due to urban heat and droughts.

## Key Policy Issues
* Urban heat island and drought degrading green spaces
* Loss of ecosystem services (cooling, recreation, habitat)
* Introduction/expansion of pests & pathogens
* Aquatic stress and species distribution shifts
* Need for resilient urban planning & green infrastructure
* Social vulnerability (elderly, health‑compromised groups)

## Sequences of Impacts

### 1. Institutional Impacts
Reduced capacity for maintenance & inspection accelerates ecosystem degradation.

### 2. Expansion of Pests & Pathogens
Heat and drought increase pest survival, reproduction and geographic range.

### 3. Drought & Heat on River Ecosystems
Aquatic habitats degrade under compounded thermal and hydrological stress.

### 4. Heat on Pests & Tree Degradation
Tree health declines; new pest assemblages emerge.

### 5. Promotion of Invasive Species
Specialised species decline; invasives exploit altered niches.

### 6. Population Dynamics & Forage Availability
Extreme heat alters growth, reproduction and food webs.

### 7. Plant Physiology
Physiological stress (photosynthesis, respiration, water regulation) reduces resilience.

### 8. Heat & Air Pollution
Elevated temperatures exacerbate pollutant formation impacting vegetation.

## Adaptation Considerations
* Expand and diversify urban green infrastructure
* Improve monitoring (pests, tree health, water quality)
* Integrate heat mitigation in land-use planning
* Early detection & biosecurity protocols for invasive species
* Nature-based solutions for riparian shading & cooling

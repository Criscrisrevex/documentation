# Climate Impact Chains (CICs)

Climate Impact Chains describe the relationship between a climate hazard and its cascading impacts across ecological, social, infrastructural and economic components of a system. They help identify indirect impacts, risks of maladaptation, feedback loops, and leverage points for intervention.

The CICs in VALORADA were co-developed with stakeholders in demonstrator regions to ensure practical relevance.

## Available Chains

| Chain | Main Risk | Hazards |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Urban Ecosystems | Degradation of urban ecosystems due to heat & drought | High temperature, drought |
| Heat & Health in Transport | Heat affecting people’s health & mobility systems | High temperature |
| Drought & Agriculture | Drought affecting agricultural production & rural livelihoods | Drought, heat |
| Wildfire | Drought & heat increasing wildfire risk | High temperature, drought |
| Floods & Rural Livelihoods | Floods affecting rural livelihoods | Extreme precipitation |

## How to Read a Chain
Each chain page includes:
1. Main risk statement (problem framing)
2. Key policy issues (action-relevant concerns)
3. Sequential impact diagrams with explanatory text
4. Narrative sequences describing causal pathways

## Using CICs for Policy & Planning
* Identify leverage points (e.g. maintenance capacity, ecosystem health, data availability)
* Expose compound risks (e.g. drought + heat → wildfire + ecosystem degradation)
* Inform adaptation strategies (early warning, resilient infrastructure, water governance)
* Support stakeholder dialogue around cascading effects

## Next Steps
Future iterations may include scoring of sequence severity, overlay of adaptation options, and links to relevant indicators in the ECDE application.

# Climate Impact Chains (CICs)

Climate Impact Chains describe relationships between climate hazards and cascading impacts across ecological, social, infrastructural and economic components. They help reveal indirect effects, risks of maladaptation, feedback loops and leverage points for adaptation.

## List of Chains
| # | Title | Main Hazards |
|---|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Urban Ecosystems Degradation | High temperature, drought |
| 2 | Heat & Health in Mobility Systems | High temperature |
| 3 | Drought & Agricultural Livelihoods | Drought, heat |
| 4 | Wildfire Risk Escalation | High temperature, drought |
| 5 | Floods & Rural Livelihoods | Extreme precipitation |

## How to Use
Each chain page contains:
* Main risk statement
* Key policy issues
* Numbered sequences showing causal pathways
* Diagrams (images) with alt text

# Climate Impact Chains (CICs)

Climate Impact Chains describe the relationship between a climate hazard and its cascading impacts across ecological, social, infrastructural and economic components of a system. They help identify indirect impacts, risks of maladaptation, feedback loops, and leverage points for intervention.

The CICs in VALORADA were co-developed with stakeholders in demonstrator regions to ensure practical relevance.

## Available Chains

| Chain | Main Risk | Hazards |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Urban Ecosystems | Degradation of urban ecosystems due to heat & drought | High temperature, drought |
| Heat & Health in Transport | Heat affecting people’s health & mobility systems | High temperature |
| Drought & Agriculture | Drought affecting agricultural production & rural livelihoods | Drought, heat |
| Wildfire | Drought & heat increasing wildfire risk | High temperature, drought |
| Floods & Rural Livelihoods | Floods affecting rural livelihoods | Extreme precipitation |

## How to Read a Chain
Each chain page includes:
1. Main risk statement (problem framing)
2. Key policy issues (action-relevant concerns)
3. Sequential impact diagrams with explanatory text
4. Narrative sequences describing causal pathways

## Using CICs for Policy & Planning
* Identify leverage points (e.g. maintenance capacity, ecosystem health, data availability)
* Expose compound risks (e.g. drought + heat → wildfire + ecosystem degradation)
* Inform adaptation strategies (early warning, resilient infrastructure, water governance)
* Support stakeholder dialogue around cascading effects

## Next Steps
Future iterations may include scoring of sequence severity, overlay of adaptation options, and links to relevant indicators in the ECDE application.

# Climate Impact Chain 5: Floods Affecting Rural Livelihoods

**Main Risk:** Floods affecting rural livelihoods.

## Key Policy Issues
* Flooding of agricultural land & infrastructure
* Dam failure & chemical contamination risks
* Outmigration & governance erosion → compound fire/hydro risks
* Need for robust flood management & rural development policies

## Sequences of Impacts

### 1. Hydrogeological Events → Chemical Pollutant Dissemination

### 2. Interruption of Public Services (Transport Networks)

## Adaptation Considerations
* Integrated flood risk & land-use planning
* Nature-based retention (wetlands, riparian buffers)
* Agricultural soil resilience practices
* Pollution control & industrial siting regulations
* Rural governance strengthening & livelihood support
* Multi-hazard planning (flood–fire interactions)

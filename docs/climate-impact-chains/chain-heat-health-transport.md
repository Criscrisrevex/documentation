# Climate Impact Chain 2: Heat Affecting Health & Mobility Systems

**Main Risk:** Heat affecting people’s health in the context of urban transport and deterioration of social & environmental determinants of health.

## Key Policy Issues
* Heat stress & accidents in urban mobility
* Infrastructure overheating
* Vulnerable groups (elderly, children, pre-existing conditions)
* Need for early warning & public health interventions
* Resilient transport & cooling spaces

## Sequences of Impacts

### 1. Heat → Air Pollution → Health Effects

## Adaptation Considerations
* Heat-health action plans & real-time alerts
* Cool pavement & shade infrastructure
* Indoor cooling (passive design, ventilation standards)
* Occupational heat safety guidelines
* Integrated water management – demand & ecosystem flow
* Surveillance for vector-, water-, and food-borne disease

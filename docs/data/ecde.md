# Copernicus Climate Change Service – European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE)

The **European Climate Data Explorer (ECDE)** is a Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) web application enabling flexible temporal and spatial exploration of historical trends and projected future changes in key climate indicators across multiple datasets.

<https://apps.copernicus-climate.eu/c3s-apps/ecde/>

## Purpose & Governance
Driven by the European Environment Agency (EEA), the ECDE addresses informational needs for national adaptation initiatives. Indicator selection is based on the European Topic Centre on Climate Change Impacts, Vulnerability and Adaptation (ETC‑CCA) technical report on hazard indices.

## Indicator Data Foundations
* Reanalysis: ERA5
* Projections: Downscaled Euro‑Cordex ensemble
* Availability: Full time series per individual model
* Documentation: [Input datasets & variables](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Input+data+underpinning+the+European+Climate+Data+Explorer%3A+Description+of+the+datasets+and+variables)
* Catalogue entry: [Climate indicators for Europe (1940–2100)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-ecde-climate-indicators?tab=overview)

## Emerging User Needs (VALORADA Context)
Non‑expert users require aggregated, simplified products to support regional/local climate risk assessment. To meet this:
* Upcoming dataset will provide multi‑model statistics
* Pre‑calculated reference periods & anomalies
* Ensemble summaries & derived climatologies
* Streamlined integration into dashboards

## Integration with VALORADA
ECDE indicators inform CIC narratives (e.g. heat stress, drought intensity, flood hazards) and feed valuation discussions under the Relevance and Strategic Value dimensions.

## Practical Usage Patterns
| Use Case | Indicator Examples | Application Benefit |
|----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Heat risk screening | TXx, tropical nights | Temporal trend & future change visualisation |
| Drought planning | SPEI, soil moisture deficits | Multi-model comparison for planning horizons |
| Flood preparedness | Extreme precipitation indices | Ensemble uncertainty framing |
| Health adaptation | Heatwave duration, humid heat | Baseline vs projected stress periods |

## Next Steps
Potential enhancements include integration of impact layers, compound indicators (e.g. fire weather), and API connectors for automated dashboard refresh.

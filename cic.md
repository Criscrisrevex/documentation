# Climate-Impact-Chains
This repository outlines each of the Climate Impact Chains developed in the course of the VALORADA project.

# Climate Impact Chains
Risks associated with climate change are often analysed in isolation, focusing only on specific economic sectors or ecosystems. However, this narrow approach can miss indirect impacts, risks of maladaptation and feedback loops. 
A climate-impact chain describes the relationship between a particular climate hazard and its impact on a specific area of influence, thereby helping identify cause-effect relationships between different components within a system. 

# Five climate impact chains and their respective hazards are displayed:

* Degradation of urban ecosystems due to urban heat and droughts -	**High temperature and Drought**
* Extreme high temperatures on people’s health in the context of urban transport -	**High temperature**
* Drought affecting agricultural production and rural livelihoods -	**Drought**
* Wildfire affecting infrastructure	- **High temperature and Drought**
* Floods affecting rural livelihoods -	**Extreme precipitation**

# Climate Impact Chains (CICs) in VALORADA
The Climate Impact Chains (CICs) were co-developed with stakeholders from VALORADA’s demonstrator regions, ensuring validation against real-world contexts. While CICs serve as a generic framework for exploring climate risks, they are also illustrated with concrete examples from the demonstrator regions, reinforcing their practical relevance and applicability.

# Exploring Climate Impact Chains
Each Climate Impact Chain includes a detailed explanation of its sequences, allowing readers to examine the potential implications of the identified risk factors. To support practical understanding, illustrative examples of policy challenges associated with each chain are provided. While not exhaustive, these examples highlight key issues and serve as a starting point for further exploration.
